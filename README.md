# Pac-Man-agents
A series of small solo projects written in Python that involves pac-man and various AI concepts. Various different agents were used for pac-man to find his dots, from simply breath first search to expectimax tree to machine learning. Balancing and optimizing with different goals and condition search time, such as avoid ghosts at all cost, optimize pathing for least time or highest score.
